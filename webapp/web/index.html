    <p>
    kanyaku is a simple user interface for the EDICT and KANJIDIC
    Japanese-English dictionary files. You type in a keyword; it
    returns related entries.
    </p>

    <h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
    <p>
    kanyaku has a simplified input editor that is sufficient for most
    common queries. Select the "character set" you want to use, and
    it transliterates what you type in the input box. The four
    options are
    </p>
    <p>
    1. <i>hiragana</i>: &#12354;
    </p>
    <p>
    2. <i>katakana</i>: &#12450;
    </p>
    <p>
    3. <i>romaji</i>: &#65313;
    </p>
    <p>
    4. ASCII: A
    </p>
    <p>
    You can choose to search either EDICT or KANJIDIC.
    </p>
    <p>
    When working with EDICT you will mostly be typing in a reading
    in <i>kana</i>. But you can also copy and paste in a phrase, or
    use your operating system's IME to input a phrase. kanyaku will
    figure out if you are searching by phrase or reading. The editor
    works as you would expect. The special case is inputting "small"
    vowels. Use the prefix <tt>\k</tt>.
    <pre><tt>chi\kea</tt>  -- >  &#12481;&#12455;&#12450;</pre>
    If you know the Unicode value of a character you can use
    <tt>\uxxxx</tt>.
    <pre><tt>\u59dc</tt>  -- >  &#23004;</pre>
    <div style="border: solid black 1px; margin: 15px;">
      <div style="text-align: center; margin: 15px;">
        <div>
        The &#171;woman&#187; in the &#171;sheep&#187 skin boots is GINGER. And she's NOT UGLY.
        </div>

      </div>
    </div>
    Press <tt>enter</tt> to submit the query.
    </p>
    <p>
    Double a consonant for &#12387;
    <pre><tt>bukkka</tt>  -- >  &#12406;&#12387;&#12363;</pre>
    Except
    <pre><tt>nn</tt>  -- >  &#12435;</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    The <i>kanji</i> characters in the phrase column of the results
    are linked to KANJIDIC, if you want to find out more about them.
    Some of the glosses have phrases that are linked back to EDICT.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can search KANJIDIC by <i>ohn</i> or <i>kun</i> reading,
    radical, grade, stroke count, SKIP number and Unicode value. For
    <i>ohn</i> readings use the <i>katakana</i> character set. For
    <i>kun</i> readings use <i>hiragana</i>. KANJIDIC uses an ASCII
    <tt>'.'</tt> to delimit <i>okurigana</i> in <i>kun</i> readings. The
    editor transliterates <tt>.</tt> to &#12290;, but it will be
    interpreted correctly.
    <pre>&#12415;&#12290;&#12427;  -- >  &#30475;  . . .</pre>
    For other search methods use the ASCII character set. Prefix the
    radical number with <tt>r</tt> (e.g. <tt>r30</tt>), grade with
    <tt>g</tt> (e.g. <tt>g6</tt>), stroke count with <tt>s</tt> (e.g.
    <tt>s12</tt>), and Unicode value with <tt>u</tt>
    (e.g. <tt>u8eca</tt>). SKIP numbers can be input as is
    (e.g. <tt>2-4-6</tt>).
    </p>
    <p>
    Type in an English keyword to do a kind of reverse lookup. It is
    not the same as a real English-Japanese dictionary, but you can
    usually find what you want.
    </p>

    <h1>Setup</h1>
    <p>
    Presumably, users of this software are more interested in Japanese
    than computers. You should be aware that this is not a desktop
    application that installs with the click of a button. This is a
    web application that you access through your browser. Actually,
    it is very similar to any website you would find on the Internet.
    The difference is you are going to host the website on your own
    computer. It works without an Internet connection. There are four
    principal components to the application.
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
   1    --------->    2   --------->    3    --------->    4
Browser            Server            Servlet            Database
        <---------        <---------         <---------
    </tt></pre>
    <p>
    <b>1.</b> Your browser. You type in what you want to find in the
    database. The browser sends the request to the server and
    waits for a response (a web page).
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>2.</b> A servlet container, or server (e.g. Tomcat, Jetty,
    other ...). The servlet container is a Java program that runs in
    the background on your computer. It waits for requests from your
    browser. When a request comes in it decides which servlet (it
    might know about several) is appropriate to the request and
    passes the request along. It waits for a reply from the servlet.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>3.</b> The servlet. A mini Java program that builds web pages.
    The servlet examines the request and responds accordingly. In
    this case the servlet creates a new request, sends it to the
    database engine (Derby) and waits for the reply. Whatever the
    database sends back is formatted in HTML and given back to the
    servlet container.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>4.</b> The database engine (Apache Derby). A Java program that
    manages databases. The setup procedure reorganizes the EDICT and
    KANJIDIC dictionaries and loads them into a database called
    <tt>jdict_db</tt>. The purpose of the kanyaku web application is
    to make working with this database simple. Instead of using the
    language of databases, SQL, you only have to type a keyword into
    the input box. The servlet knows how to talk to the database.
    Whatever the database engine finds the servlet sends back to you
    in a readable format.
    </p>
    <p>
    Because the web application has several independent parts, the
    setup procedure can be somewhat involved. This section assumes
    you do not have any experience with Java. It attempts to walk you
    throught the steps without being overly technical.
    </p>
    <p>
    Before you begin you should verify that you have Java installed.
    Open a command shell window and type
    </p>
    <p>
    <tt>java -version</tt>
    </p>
    <p>
    You should see a message similar to
    </p>
    <pre><tt>java version "1.8.0_05"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_05-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.5-b02, mixed-mode)</tt></pre>
    <p>
    If it appears that the command failed, you will have to install
    the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). See
    <a href="#about_java">About Java</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Here is a summary of the steps you will take to setup the
    application:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Get the kanyaku distribution.</li>
      <li>Get Apache Ant (Optional).</li>
      <li>Get a servlet container.</li>
      <li>Get the dictionary files.</li>
      <li>Compile the source code (Optional).</li>
      <li>Create the database.</li>
      <li>Prepare the database tables.</li>
      <li>Load the database tables.</li>
      <li>Deploy the webapp.</li>
      <li>Start the server.</li>
      <li>Set derby.system.home</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Using Ant</h2>
    <p>
    Ant is a tool commonly used to automate Java development tasks.
    It is not required here, but it can make things a little easier.
    For example, you will be able to get the latest dictionary files
    with the command
    </p>
    <tt>ant update</tt>
    <p>
    which downloads the files and puts them in the correct location.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ant is a Java program. It reads instructions from a file,
    <tt>build.xml</tt>, and executes them. You will not need to
    understand how it works. Just make sure it is installed
    correctly. The Ant manual tells you how to do so. Go to
    <pre><tt><a href="http://ant.apache.org/index.html">http://ant.apache.org</a></tt></pre>
    and find the binary distribution.
    Download the archive and unpack it in a directory of your choice.
    Read the "Installing Apache Ant" section of the manual
    (<tt>ANT_HOME/manual/index.html</tt>). When you are done you
    should be able to open a command shell window and type
    <pre><tt>ant -version</tt></pre>
    which will print something like
    <pre><tt>Apache Ant(TM) version 1.9.3 compiled on December 23 2013</tt></pre>
    </p>
    <h2>The Servlet Container</h2>
    <p>
    A servlet container is a kind of web server that knows how to
    work with Java servlets. One or more servlets can be put together
    to build a web application. The servlet container can manage
    several web applications simultaneously by giving each of them
    a unique name/address. We are calling this application kanyaku,
    but you could give it another name. To run the application you
    will (1) copy it to a directory specified by the server, (2)
    start the server, (3) type the URL into your browser's address
    box. The URL for this very page will be something like
    <pre><tt>http://localhost:8080/kanyaku</tt></pre>
    </p>
    <h3>Jetty</h3>
    <p>
    Jetty is a servlet container that is relatively easy to get
    started with. It is powerful software, but you will only need to
    know the basics to use the kanyaku web application. You can
    download Jetty from
    <pre><tt><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/download.html">https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/download.html</a></tt></pre>
    You should read the first
    two chapters of the manual and ensure that you can successfully
    start the server. At its simplest you will be able to use the
    command
    <pre><tt>java -jar start.jar</tt></pre>
    from the Jetty installation directory. Stop the server by typing
    <pre><tt>CTRL-C</tt></pre>
    In the default configuration web applications are placed in the
    <tt>webapps</tt> directory under <tt>JETTY_HOME</tt>. It is
    possible to put your web applications elsewhere. Read more about
    the <tt>jetty.base</tt> Java system property in Chapter 9 of the
    manual.
    </p>
    <h3>Apache Tomcat</h3>
    <p>
    Tomcat offers a Windows installer that will run the server as a
    service. This allows the server to be started automatically.
    There is a handy configuration tool to help with the startup
    parameters. Other than that the basics are similar to Jetty. You
    will put your application in the <tt>webapps</tt> directory,
    start the server if necessary and use your browser to work with
    the application(s). Read the first five chapters of the User
    Guide and the file <tt>RUNNING.txt</tt> to find out how to start
    the server manually. Tomcat also comes with a built-in manager
    web application that you can use to deploy your application(s).

<pre><tt><a href="http://tomcat.apache.org">http://tomcat.apache.org</a></tt></pre>
    to learn more.
    </p>
    <h2>The Dictionaries</h2>
    <p>
    kanyaku depends on the
    <!--
    <a href="http://ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/edict2">
    -->
    <a href="ftp://ftp.edrdg.org/pub/Nihongo/edict2">
    EDICT
    </a> and
    <!--
    <a href="http://ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/kanjidic">
    -->
    <a href="ftp://ftp.edrdg.org/pub/Nihongo/kanjidic">
    KANJIDIC
    </a>
    dictionary files. These are generously made available by
    <!--
    <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/japanese.html">
    -->
    <a href="http://nihongo.monash.edu/japanese.html">
    Jim Breen
    </a> at Monash University. Before you can build the database you
    have to get these two files. If you are using Ant you can do so
    with this command (after opening a command shell window and
    navigating to the kanyaku installation directory)
    <pre><tt>ant update</tt></pre>
    Otherwise, create a new directory in the kanyaku installation
    directory called <tt>dic</tt>.
    </p>
    Download the files from
<!--
<pre><tt><a href="http://ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/edict2">http://ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/edict2</a></tt></pre>
-->
<pre><tt><a href="ftp://ftp.edrdg.org/pub/Nihongo/edict2">ftp://ftp.edrdg.org/pub/Nihongo/edict2</a></tt></pre>
    and
<!--
<pre><tt><a href="http://ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/kanjidic">http://ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/kanjidic</a></tt></pre>
-->
<pre><tt><a href="ftp://ftp.edrdg.org/pub/Nihongo/kanjidic">ftp://ftp.edrdg.org/pub/Nihongo/kanjidic</a></tt></pre>

    Save them as plain text files in the <tt>dic</tt> directory with
    the names <tt>edict2</tt> and <tt>kanjidic</tt> (without any file
    extension). These files are EUC-JP encoded. Make sure not to
    change the encoding along the way. To verify that they have not
    been corrupted, open them in your browser and set the page
    encoding to EUC-JP. If you see gibberish, something went wrong.
    Once the database has been built these two files are no longer
    required. You can keep them for reference. Or not.

    <h2>Compile The Source Code</h2>
    <p>
    Unless you like to tinker with the code you do not need to bother
    with this.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are two separate sets of Java source. The database utility
    files are in the <tt>java</tt> directory. The servlet files are
    in <tt>webapp/src</tt>. Compile everything with the command
    <pre><tt>ant compile</tt></pre>
    Or compile them separately with
    <pre><tt>ant compile_jdict</tt></pre>
    and
    <pre><tt>ant compile_webapp</tt></pre>
    Before you compile the servlet you will have to locate the
    servlet API library in your servlet container distribution.
    It will probably be in a <tt>lib</tt> directory and have a name
    like <tt>servlet-api.jar</tt>. To tell the build script the
    location of the library create a file called
    <tt>build.properties</tt> in the kanyaku installation directory
    (if it does not already exist) and add this line to it
    <pre><tt>servlet_api_jar=/path/to/servlet.jar</tt></pre>
    where the path is the full path name of the servlet API jar file.
    </p>
    <p>
    The servlet class files will end up in
    <tt>webapp/build/WEB-INF/classes</tt>. The contents of the
    <tt>webapp/build</tt> directory will have a standard uncompressed
    web application structure. You could then install it by<br/>
    1. Creating a directory called <tt>kanyaku</tt> in the
    <tt>webapps</tt> directory of the server.<br/>
    2. Copying the -contents- of <tt>webapp/build</tt> to
    <tt>&lt;SERVER_HOME&gt;/webapps/kanyaku</tt>. (Do not copy the
    directory, only its contents.)<br/>
    The Tomcat manager can help you deploy the <tt>build</tt>
    directory. With Jetty you will have to do it by hand.
    </p>
    <p>
    The command
    <pre><tt>ant make_war</tt></pre>
    packages <tt>webapp/build</tt> into <tt>kanyaku.war</tt> (in
    <tt>webapp</tt>) which can also be used to deploy the
    application. There is no need to create a new directory. Just
    copy <tt>kanyaku.war</tt> to
    <tt>&lt;SERVER_HOME&gt;/webapps</tt>. Tomcat manager can do this
    for you.
    </p>

    <h2>Create The Database</h2>
    <p>
    kanyaku stores the dictionaries in a Derby database. By default
    the database will be called <tt>jdict_db</tt> and be located in
    the kanyaku installation directory.
    <pre><tt>ant create_db</tt></pre>
    creates the database. If you are not using Ant use this command
    <pre><tt>echo show tables; | java -cp lib/derbytools.jar;lib/derby.jar -Dderby.system.home=. -Dij.connection.JDICT_DB=jdbc:derby:jdict_db;create=true;territory=ja_JP;collation=TERRITORY_BASED org.apache.derby.tools.ij
</tt></pre>
    Derby does not have a <tt>DROP DATABASE</tt> SQL statement. If
    something goes wrong and you want to start over, delete the
    <tt>jdict_db</tt> directory and everything in it.
    </p>

    <h2>Prepare The Database Tables</h2>
    <p>
    If you are interested in the table definitions, they are in
    <tt>sql/create_tables.sql</tt>. Execute the SQL script with the
    command
    <pre><tt>ant create_tables</tt></pre>
    To run the script manually
    <pre><tt>java -cp lib/derbytools.jar;lib/derby.jar -Dderby.system.home=. -Dij.connection.JDICT_DB=jdbc:derby:jdict_db  org.apache.derby.tools.ij sql/create_tables.sql</tt></pre>
    If you are NOT using Ant execute the following command
    <pre><tt>java -cp lib/derbytools.jar;lib/derby.jar;java -Dderby.system.home=. -Dedict.input.dir=dic -Dedict.output.dir=sql JDictPrepare
</tt></pre>
    This creates some additional SQL scripts and puts them in the
    <tt>sql</tt> directory.
    </p>

    <h2>Load The Database Tables</h2>
    <p>
    OK. It is time to be patient. EDICT has 170,000+ entries and
    KANJIDIC 6000+. Each of these spawns multiple SQL <tt>INSERT</tt>
    statements that have to be executed one at a time. It takes a
    while. You may want to grab a cup of coffee. Get the ball rolling
    with
    <pre><tt>ant load_tables</tt></pre>
    or
    <pre><tt>java -cp lib/derbytools.jar;lib/derby.jar -Dderby.system.home=. -Dij.connection.JDICT_DB=jdbc:derby:jdict_db org.apache.derby.tools.ij sql/load_tables.ij</tt></pre>
    When that finishes you can try
    <pre><tt>ant check_db</tt></pre>
    to see that the tables have been populated. The number of rows
    reported for each table should equal the number of
    <tt>INSERT</tt> statements in its respective <tt>.sql</tt> file.
    </p>
    <p>
    You are free to work with the database directly if you want. Find
    the documentation for Derby at
    <pre><tt><a href="http://db.apache.org/derby">http://db.apache.org/derby</a></tt></pre>
    You will want to look at the table definitions to see how the
    database is organized. Most of the multi-valued attributes have
    their own tables.
    </p>

    <h2>Deploy The Application</h2>
    <p>
    Copy <tt>kanyaku.war</tt> in the <tt>webapp</tt> directory to the
    <tt>webapps</tt> directory of your servlet container (or wherever
    it directs you to put <tt>.war</tt> files).
    </p>

    <h2>Start The Server</h2>
    <p>
    The server's documentation will explain how to start the server
    and what the default port number is. Assuming the port number is
    8080 you will find this application at
    <pre><tt><a href="http://localhost:8080/kanyaku">http://localhost:8080/kanyaku</a></tt></pre>
    </p>

    <h2>derby.system.home</h2>
    <p>
    The database engine depends on a Java system property called
    <tt>derby.system.home</tt>. It is the full path to the directory
    where Derby databases are located. The web application has to be
    informed of where the kanyaku installation directory (the defualt
    location of the database) is on your computer. To do this you will
    edit the <tt>web.xml</tt> file.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you have deployed <tt>kanyaku.war</tt> successfully the server
    will have created a directory called <tt>kanyaku</tt> in its
    <tt>webapps</tt> directory (or wherever the server keeps webapps).
    Open the file <tt>kanyaku/WEB-INF/web.xml</tt> with your text
    editor. Find the section that looks like
<pre><tt>
&lt;context-param&gt;
  &lt;param-name&gt;derby_system_home&lt;/param-name&gt;
  &lt;param-value&gt;&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/context-param&gt;
</tt></pre>
    Type the full path name of the kanyaku installation directory
    between the <tt>param-value</tt> tags
<pre><tt>
&lt;context-param&gt;
  &lt;param-name&gt;derby_system_home&lt;/param-name&gt;
  &lt;param-value&gt;C:/path/to/kanyaku&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/context-param&gt;
</tt></pre>
    and save the file.
    </p>
    <p>
    Restart the server for the new value to take effect.
    </p>

    <h2 id="about_java">About Java</h2>
    "Java" refers to both a programming language and a computer
    program. Programs written in the language are executed by
    <tt>java</tt>, a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
    The command
    <pre><tt>java MyProgram</tt></pre>
    starts the Java system and tells it to run <tt>MyProgram</tt>. 
    If your computer does not already have the JRE installed you will
    have to get it from

    Follow the installation instructions for your particular operating
    system. If you want to write your own programs (or modify this one)
    you need the Java Development Kit (JDK).
